# Medical-Insurance-Prediction-Model
his project uses Linear Regression to predict insurance charges based on multiple personal and demographic factors. The model helps estimate how much an individual might be charged for insurance based on attributes like age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and annual salary.

🔍 Objective
To develop a regression model that can accurately forecast medical insurance costs using linear relationships between the target variable (charges) and features such as:

age

sex

bmi

smoker (Yes/No)

region

annual salary (or other income-related feature, if included)

number of children

📊 What This Project Includes
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Data preprocessing: encoding categorical variables and handling numeric features.

Model training using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

Model evaluation using:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Predictions on custom input data.

✅ Key Insight
The model highlights age, BMI, and smoking status as strong influencers of insurance charges, with smokers and older individuals generally facing higher costs.
